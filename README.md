## **Motivation**

- I want to share what
  - I know already in a structured way
  - I've learned from the years of experience as a Software Engineer
- be open
- be helpful to others

I am constantly working to become a better version of myself via good habits, self-improvements and autodidactism.

I'll be happy if this will help you to perform better in one way or another.
