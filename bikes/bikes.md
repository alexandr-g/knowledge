# Bikes

**A bike** is the main form of transportation for me from **environmental** and health benefits reasons.
I enjoy riding on fresh air, I love the freedom feeling. I cycle every day to work and for my errands.

But not only. The bike is a hobby, style, adorable simplicity and mobility to me, rather than just a piece of metal.
