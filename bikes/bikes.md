# Bikes

**A bike** is the main form of transportation for me from **environmental** and health benefits reasons.
I enjoy riding on fresh air, I love the freedom feeling. I cycle every day to work and for my errands.

But not only. The bike is a hobby, style, adorable simplicity and mobility to me, rather than just a piece of metal.

## Bike renting companies for a continues usage in Berlin based on subscription

You don't want to buy a bike at all? No problem, you can rent it for a longer usage from the following companies:

- [Swapfiets](https://swapfiets.de/en/) - is a start up company. They offer subscription service for your own bike for €19.50 per Month. You pay as long as you need the bike and they take care of replacements or reparation if needed. I like how their bikes look and the idea in general.

- [Vanmoof](https://www.vanmoof.com/de_de/) - is a popular holland modern bike manufacturer. Besides buying a bike from them, you can also rent it for a long time.
