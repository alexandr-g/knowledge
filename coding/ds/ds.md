# Data Structures

## What is a Data Structure?

A **data structure** (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

## Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures

An **abstract data type** (ADT) is an abstraction of the data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface doest not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.
