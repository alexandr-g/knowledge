# Data Structures

## What is a Data Structure?

A **data structure** (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

## Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures

An **abstract data type** (ADT) is an abstraction of the data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface doest not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

## Examples

| Abstraction (ADT) |   Implementation (DS)   |
| :---------------: | :---------------------: |
|       List        |      Dynamic Array      |
|                   |       Linked List       |
|       Queue       | Linked List based Queue |
|                   |    Array based Queue    |
|                   |    Stack based Queue    |
|        Map        |        Tree Map         |
|                   |  Hash Map / Hash Table  |
|      Vehicle      |        Golf Cart        |
|                   |         Bicycle         |
