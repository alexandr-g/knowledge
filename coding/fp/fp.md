# Functional Programming

## Books

- [Grokking Simplicity by Eric Normand](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-simplicity)

## Libraries

- [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/)

> There are already several excellent libraries with a functional flavor. Typically, they are meant to be general-purpose toolkits, suitable for working in multiple paradigms. Ramda has a more focused goal. We wanted a library designed specifically for a functional programming style, one that makes it easy to create functional pipelines, one that never mutates user data.

- [lodash/fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide)

> The lodash/fp module promotes a more functional programming (FP) friendly style by exporting an instance of lodash with its methods wrapped to produce immutable auto-curried iteratee-first data-last methods.
