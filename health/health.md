# Health

I am taking my health very seriously and follow the habits below.
All of this is helping me to be more productive and accomplish more during the day.

## Exercise regularly

I like to mix different types of activities during the week.

#### Lifting weights (aka gym)

I am hitting the gym three times per week working on different groups of muscles. I start with 6-8 mins warm-up cardio before the main part.

#### Running

When I am not lifting weights I am running. I run 2 to 3 times per week.

I prefer running in the evening after work, in a forest around a lake. I know some people love running in the early morning before the day begins.

#### Swimming

I swim 1 to 2 times per week. In the warmer periods often. I prefer to swim in open-air locations. Thankfully, there are a lot of great lakes in **Berlin**. I especially like to swim in cold water. Usually, I'm swimming till late September (swam on Oct 14th in the lake in Berlin, end of September in Baltic sea, Copenhagen, Denmark). In winter inside indoor swimming pools (50 meters lane is perfect).

#### Cycling

A bicycle is the main form of transportation for me. I cycle to work every day in a total of 12 kilometers in both ways.

## Food

Food is your fuel. What you eat is essential for how you feel. I avoid junk and often pre-processed food. My diet consists of a lot of raw fresh food, vegetables and low to none meat consumption.
I've been vegetarian for 7 years in the past, even before it gained popularity.

## Get enough sleep

I allocate between 7 and 8 hours per day for sleep. Rule of thumb would be at the bed before 22:00 max 22:30.

I wake up at 6:00 - 6:30 every day. I've tried to join the "5 am a club" but find out that it is very stressful for my organism.

## Drink enough water per day

I am always having water around me, on my desk and the go. Stay hydrated.

## Meditation

I try to meditate before going to bed and after waking up. That way I clean my mind and prepare for the upcoming day.

## Cold shower

I practice cold shower, especially, during warm months. In winter that becomes harder :) Give it a try!

## Schedule

Have a regular schedule. Start your day early. Consistency is the key.
