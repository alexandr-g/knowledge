# November 2019

## A month general

Working & Learning. Writing more [for my blog](https://oleks.pro). Got **8 articles** written to the blog compared to 2 articles in October. I started to invest some time into improving the blog project, fighting legacy. Changed production deployments to Zeit Now.

## Communication

Impressed how important it is talking to other people, align goals and vision and bring everyone on the same page. A lot of problems can be solved via communication and this could save you time or prevent going in the wrong direction.

## Learning

Invested in physical programming books and online courses on Udemy. Extended [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/) premium subscription.

I had an amazing weekend in Budapest. Writing this on my way.
