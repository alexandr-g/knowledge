# 2019

It's been a great, successful and a bit hectic year for me. My personal situation changed, I traveled a lot, visited relatives, balancing between work, personal stuff and learnings.

I've tried to squeeze and achieve a lot at the same. Focusing on completing stuff and getting things done.

## Work

We squash all the commits, so even if I made 50 commits on the PR that would be counted as 1 merge commit for me. This data is not very reflective.

## Travel

I've been traveling almost every month. With this schedule, I'm starting to forget all the countries and destinations I've traveled to. Keeping track of them in a list definitely helps.

I discovered new countries for me. They were:

- Italy:

  - Rome in March
  - Milan in December

- Spain (Barcelona) - September
- Greece:
  - Kefalonia in June
  - Kos in July

Other destinations:

- Kyiv, Ukraine

  - January
  - October

- Budapest in November

## Health / Gym

It's been one year since I started to attend the gym and taking training seriously (2-3 pieces of training per week). Persistence is the key here. I achieved notable results and my physical form improved a lot. I am very happy with this. Also, I do not forget running, cycling and swimming just to balance the physical load. Doing sports helps me with my mental state and overall performance.

The only thing, I haven't figured out yet how to maintain the form while traveling since I prefer to travel light.

## Looking forward

I'm very excited about 2020. I'll try to push it, on the whole, another level. Set on goals.
